## Project flow

main.py file read images from data folder and swap paintings with random puppy images and save the result inside "swappedImages".

## Note

This solution is based on conventional image processing technique using opencv. Solution is focussed on to avoid false positive which result in prosucing few false negative (missing some painting).
Results can be further improved by introducing object detection that will help to narrow down the focussing area in images but this was not implemented due to time constraint of the task.
